    # Default ini options for sessions.
    #
    # Some distributions of Linux (most notably Debian) ship their PHP
    # installations with garbage collection (gc) disabled. Since Drupal depends
    # on PHP's garbage collection for clearing sessions, ensure that garbage
    # collection occurs by using the most common settings.

    # @default 100
    gc_divisor: 100
    #
    # Set session lifetime (in seconds), i.e. the grace period for session
    # data. Sessions are deleted by the session garbage collector after one
    # session lifetime has elapsed since the user's last visit. When a session
    # is deleted, authenticated users are logged out, and the contents of the
    # user's session is discarded.
    # @default 200000
    gc_maxlifetime: 28800
    #
    # Set session cookie lifetime (in seconds), i.e. the time from the session
    # is created to the cookie expires, i.e. when the browser is expected to
    # discard the cookie. The value 0 means "until the browser is closed".
    # @default 2000000
    cookie_lifetime: 2000000
    #
    # Drupal automatically generates a unique session cookie name based on the
    # full domain name used to access the site. This mechanism is sufficient
    # for most use-cases, including multi-site deployments. However, if it is
    # desired that a session can be reused across different subdomains, the
    # cookie domain needs to be set to the shared base domain. Doing so assures
    # that users remain logged in as they cross between various subdomains.
    # To maximize compatibility and normalize the behavior across user agents,
    # the cookie domain should start with a dot.
    #
    # @default none
    # cookie_domain: '.example.com'
    #
    # Set the session ID string length. The length can be between 22 to 256. The
    # PHP recommended value is 48. See
    # https://www.php.net/manual/session.security.ini.php for more information.
    # This value should be kept in sync with
    # \Drupal\Core\Session\SessionConfiguration::__construct()
    # @default 48
    sid_length: 48
    #
    # Set the number of bits in encoded session ID character. The possible
    # values are '4' (0-9, a-f), '5' (0-9, a-v), and '6' (0-9, a-z, A-Z, "-",
    # ","). The PHP recommended value is 6. See
    # https://www.php.net/manual/session.security.ini.php for more information.
